Terminal 20.1.8

Concept
Terminal 20.1.8 is a webpage that reflects on web intervention through the unconventional and counter intuitive functions of a terminal. It explores a twilight zone version of a tool that is meant to be helpful, but isn’t helpful and a tool that is supposed to be efficient, becomes more of an annoyance. The typical terminal is an interface integrated in every computer and is used to execute command lines. Its purpose is to easily access your computer’s data and execute a set of commands quickly. However, in this webpage, the terminal does the complete opposite. Privacy is another concern where a terminal can access a user’s entire computer database but without seeing the actual content. In TERMINAL, the user’s facial identity, voice and location is captured, which is meant to show exposure of the user, rather than keeping them confidential. Lastly, obscurity is another key element in the experience of this webpage. Not knowing what to do or the lack of direction and purpose is meant to make the user question how much of technology we should trust and whether we should see it in a more humanizing way. The TERMINAL in return dehumanizes us, as the user for the way that we treat it.

User Experience
The user first lands on the webpage with just the standard beginning text of any terminal. No directions are given out to the user at first and so the user must find out through curiosity of what interactions can be done. Typically, an individual would access a regular terminal with knowledge and a purpose, but in this case, the user is meant to feel degraded and submissive to the TERMINAL. Eventually, the user will realize that there is a blinking caret to indicate that there is an area that can be typed into. Instinctively, the user will end up typing anything and at hitting ‘enter’, the TERMINAL will vocally say and question the user’s knowledge. At some point, one of the things the TERMINAL will say will hint at the next interaction. As the user continues to be blindly guided by the TERMINAL, the commands that the user will execute will give the opposite of what they’re originally meant to do which would lead to very unexpected and unwanted events.

Implementations
The main commands and easter egg interactions are the main functionalities of this webpage. Each of the commands and interactions are coded in commands.js file separate from the main.js. On the commands.js file includes the function for each command and interaction. The webpage uses APIs such as Google Maps, WebRTC, responsiveVoice, download, etc.  

Functionality
clear command (Triggers binary code)
help command (Randomizes life pro tips)
exit command (Opens social media websites)
invalid command (ResponsiveVoice activated)

Coming Soon...
info command (Lists user name, date of birth, triggers live WebRTC preview, finds location using Google Maps)
other (Randomizes ASCII art)
